    "# PA9 HITS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We will briefly discuss HITS algorithm, an alternative algorithm to PageRank, that is another popular node ranking algorithm in graphs. For an in-depth description of the algorithm, please refer to <a href=\"http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/Lecture4/lecture4.html\"> this link </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm was developed by Jon M. Kleinberg, and the original paper can be found <a href=\"https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/auth.pdf\"> here </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Authorities and Hubs\n",
    "When searching for information online, there are two main categories of webpages you will tend to run accross. **Authority** refers to a webpage that contains valuable information on a subject, and **hubs** are webpages that advertise the aurhoritative pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let us say you look up a good laptop to purchase for work or personal use. An **authority** web page you find during such a search might be the home page of microsoft, apple, lenovo, or other companies that sell laptops. A **hub** page may be a laptop review site, such as pcmag. (Note: We are not vouching that pcmag is a trusted review site, please conduct your own research before making any purchase). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Authority and Hub Score\n",
    "Now that we have defined what it means for a page to be an authority or hub, we can assign an **authority score** and **hub score** to each webpage. A higher **authority score** occurs if the page is pointed to by pages with high **hub scores**. A higher **hub score** occurs if the page points to many pages with high **authority scores**. As you can see, the scores are highly recursive. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can keep track of the scores of all webpages in two separate vectors:\n",
    "1. **Authority vector**, in which each element, $a_i$, will contain the authority score of page i\n",
    "2. **Hub vector**, in which each element, $h_i$, will contain the hub score of page i.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that each page has both an authority score and hub score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical definition of HITS\n",
    "Given an adjacency matrix of a directed graph, HITS computes the hub and authority score vectors which can be used for ranking nodes in the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input**: adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{A}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ of a graph $G=(V, E)$\n",
    "* **Output**: hub score vector $\\mathbf{h} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and authority score vector $\\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $\\mathbf{h} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{a}$\n",
    "    - $\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{A}^{\\top}\\mathbf{h}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The above equations are called the equations for HITS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that HITS does not require the row-normalized adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative Algorithm for HITS\n",
    "The hub and authority score vectors, $\\mathbf{h}$ and $\\mathbf{a}$, are obtained by iteratively computing the equations for HITS.   \n",
    "Note that for each iteration, we need to L2-normalize the vectors $\\mathbf{h}$ and $\\mathbf{a}$.\n",
    "The following pseudo-code represents the iterative algorithm for HITS. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./iterative-algorithm-hits_pic.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exact solution of HITS\n",
    "\n",
    "We can directly compute the hub and authority score vectors of HITS as follows:\n",
    "* The hub score vector $\\mathbf{h}$ is the principle eigenvector of $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^{\\top}$.\n",
    "* The authority score vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is the principle eigenvector of $\\mathbf{A}^{\\top}\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle eigenvector of a matrix is an eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue. \n",
    "Suppose the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the adjacency matrix is $\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{V}^{\\top}$. Then,\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{h}$ is the first (most left) vector of $\\mathbf{U}$. \n",
    "* $\\mathbf{a}$ is the first (most left) vector of $\\mathbf{V}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not describe the detailed proofs for the above statements, but we can use them as the exact solutions for the hub and authority score vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement the following function to compute the exact solutions. \n",
    "Note that since the adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is a sparse matrix, we will use `svds` (sparse SVD) in `scipy`.\n",
    "* `svds`: this performs SVD on a sparse matrix\n",

    "\n",
    "## Sparse Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we introduce a representation of matrices and matrix operations in scipy called \"**Compressed Sparse Row matrix (CSR)**\", that is very useful for sparse matrices, namely graphs that have relatively few edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of its documentation can be found at this link <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html\"> at this link </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that the adjacency matrix, \"self.A\" in the code below is not loaded in as a np array. As such if you wanted to take the matrix multiplication of \"self.A\" and another matrix, B, you **cannot** call np.matmul(A,B) nor can you call np.dot(A,B). Both of these commands will throw an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to the documentation link above. Under \"Methods\" you will find a list of functions and their appropriate syntax (including the method call for matrix multiplication). \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## List of tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is quite long and the pieces you need to complete are not all in one place.\n",
